# Biofilm Analysis 

This folder contains the step-by-step workflow of the biofilm analysis I performed in QIIME2 and the resulted taxa barplot. For this analysis, I followed the Moving Pictures tutorial: https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/moving-pictures/. The goal of this analysis was to identify the taxonomic composition of the 5 biofilm samples I collected during the larval settlement study (the samples were taken from the first 5 blocks of the settlement study). To collect samples, I fouled 3 petri dishes per replicate and pooled the samples of the 3 dishes into 1 sample, resulting in 5 total samples. The samples were maintained at -80C until extraction. I gave our samples to the UNH Hubbard Genome Center to perform 16s extractions and sequencing, which resulted in paired-end demultiplexed reads.
