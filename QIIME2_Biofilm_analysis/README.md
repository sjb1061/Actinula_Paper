# Biofilm Analysis 

This folder contains the step-by-step workflow of a biofilm analysis using QIIME2. We did not include this study in the MSI paper. For this analysis, I followed the Moving Pictures tutorial: https://docs.qiime2.org/2020.6/tutorials/moving-pictures/. The goal of this analysis was to identify the taxonomic composition of 5 biofilm samples that I collected during the larval settlement study (the samples were taken from the first 5 blocks of the settlement study). To collect samples, I fouled 3 petri dishes per replicate and pooled the samples of the 3 dishes into 1 sample, resulting in 5 total samples. The samples were maintained at -80C until extraction. The UNH Hubbard Genome Center performed 16s extractions and sequencing, which resulted in paired-end demultiplexed reads. Since we do not have replication of each sample, we did not include this analysis/study in the MSI actinula paper.
