# Actinula_Paper
Welcome!  
This repository contains my developmental transcriptome and gene expression work for the actinula paper along with the R scripts used to make figures. For a general overview of the workflow and the scripts used at each step, please see the actinula_workflow.md file. All scripts can be found in the scripts_for_analysis folder. For a detailed explaination and step by step instruction of this analysis, please see the step_by_step_actinula_analysis.md file. I will be adding a folder containing my R scripts used to make figures later down the line. I have also added an output folder called transcriptome_work_output_files which contains the outputs from steps 5-9 that are needed for the R scripts in the transcriptome workflow. There will also be a folder added soon which will contain the R scripts used for analysing the larval settlement study.
