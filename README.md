# Actinula_Paper
Welcome!  
This repository contains my developmental transcriptome and gene expression work for the actinula paper, the R scripts used to make figures, the larval settlement analysis scripts and the biofilm QIIME analysis work. For a general overview of the transcriptome workflow and the scripts used at each step, please see the actinula_workflow.md file. All transcriptome/gene expression work scripts can be found in the scripts_for_analysis folder. For a detailed explaination and step by step instruction of this analysis, please see the step_by_step_actinula_analysis.md file. I have also added an output folder called transcriptome_work_output_files which contains the outputs from steps 5-9 that are needed for the R scripts in the transcriptome workflow. I am currently working on adding to the Settlement_Behavior_Analysis folder which contains the R scripts and data used for analysing the larval settlement study. A folder for the QIIME analysis and workflow will also be added soon. Lastly, I will add a folder containing my R scripts used to make the figures in the paper later down the line.
