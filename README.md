# Actinula_Paper

This repository contains the actinula developmental transcriptome study and gene expression analysis, the actinula larval settlement study analysis, the biofilm QIIME2 analysis (not included in the paper), and the workflow for designing RNA FISH Probes for the paper: Multisensory integration (MSI) by polymodal sensory neurons dictates larval settlement in a brainless cnidarian larva (https://biorxiv.org/cgi/content/short/2022.11.02.514770v1). 

For a general overview of the transcriptome workflow and the scripts used at each step, please see the *actinula_transcriptome_workflow.md* file. All transcriptome/gene expression scripts can be found in the *scripts_for_analysis folder*. For a detailed explaination and step by step instruction of this analysis, please see the *step_by_step_actinula_analysis.md* file. I have also added an output folder called *transcriptome_work_output_files* which contains the outputs from steps 5-11 that are needed for the R scripts in the transcriptome workflow. The *Settlement_Behavior_Analysis* folder contains the R scripts and data used for analysing the larval settlement study and generating figures. The *QIIME2_Biofilm_analysis* folder contains an analysis examining the taxonomic compositon of the biofilm that was used in the larval settlement study (not included in the paper). Lastly, I will add a folder containing the workflow for generating RNA FISH probes.
