 # Folder Overview
   
   This folder contains the output files used in the R scripts starting at step 5, the orthofinder run. Each output file will have a number prefix that corresponds to either the step or the script that was used to generate that file. Note that some steps might not have output files because their outputs were not needed for the R scripts.
