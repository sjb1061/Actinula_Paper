# Actinula_Paper
Welcome!  
This repository contains my actinula developmental transcriptome and gene expression work, the actinula larval settlement analysis scripts, the biofilm QIIME2 analysis work, and the R scripts used to make figures for the actinula paper. For a general overview of the transcriptome workflow and the scripts used at each step, please see the *actinula_transcriptome_workflow.md* file. All transcriptome/gene expression work scripts can be found in the *scripts_for_analysis folder*. For a detailed explaination and step by step instruction of this analysis, please see the *step_by_step_actinula_analysis.md* file. I have also added an output folder called *transcriptome_work_output_files* which contains the outputs from steps 5-11 that are needed for the R scripts in the transcriptome workflow. I have also added a folder called *Settlement_Behavior_Analysis* which contains the R scripts and data used for analysing the larval settlement study. A folder for the QIIME2 analysis and workflow has also be added (*QIIME2_Biofilm_analysis*). Lastly, I will add a folder containing my R scripts used to make the figures in the paper later down the line.
