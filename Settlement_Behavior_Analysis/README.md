# Settlement Behavior Analysis Overview 

   This folder contains the scripts used in the larval settlement analysis and their data sets. There are 2 scripts here, the full larval settlement study and the mechanosensory pilot study. The experiemental design of the full larval settement study is a 7x4 split plot RCBD with 10 blocks which investigates all three sensory cues (light, chem, and texture). The mechanosensory pilot study was performed before the full larval settlement study and investigated 3 textures along with a control in two different light conditions (experimental design: 2x4 split Plot RCBD with 7 Blocks). In both studies we used stage 3 actinula larvae  and used the area under the curve (AUC) as our response variable which shows the rate of settlement over time.
